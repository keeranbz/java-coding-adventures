# Java Coding Adventures

## Progress Bar
directory: *progress-bar/*_emphasize_
A cli loading program. (incomplete)

Compile/Run:
1. javac ProgressBar.java
2. java ProgressBar

TODO:
- convert it to usable class.
- add comments and doc comments.
- create runner program in same folder.
- cite sources.
- add feature that let's you choose the output string.

Lesson:
- "\r" sets the cursor at the start of the line. Does it clear text or overwrite?


## Possibilities
- Increment/Decrement before and after variable. ++x, x++, --x, x--
